# Terraform-Two-Tier-Architecture 
In this project, we will be using Terraform (HCL) to setup a Two-Tier Architecture along with a Application Load Balancer using the AWS provider.
You will see how to setup your infrastructure with multiple security groups, public and private subnets, and how to associate your network infrastructure with your AWS EC2 instances.
Finally, we have some sample variable usage along with the bootstrap scripts that will be used when provisioning our EC2 instances.
